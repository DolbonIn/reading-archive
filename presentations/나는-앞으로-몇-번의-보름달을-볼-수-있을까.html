          <p class="slide-part-title">Part 1: The Final Chapter</p>
          <h2 class="slide-title">Living with <span class="highlight">Cancer</span></h2>
          <p class="slide-content">The book begins with a profound question that shaped Sakamoto's final years, turning an abstract line from a film into a daily, personal meditation.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Slide 5: The Opening Question -->
      <div class="slide">
        <div class="slide-container">
          <h2 class="slide-title">"How many more full moons will I see?"</h2>
          <p class="slide-subtitle">This question, which became the title of his memoir, originated from a line spoken by author Paul Bowles in the film <i>The Sheltering Sky</i>.</p>
          <div class="slide-content">
            <p>For a long time, the line remained a powerful but distant quote. However, after his first cancer diagnosis in 2014, it became a deeply personal reflection on his own mortality.</p>
            <div class="mt-8 p-6 bg-gray-50 border border-gray-200 rounded-lg">
              <h3 class="font-bold text-lg">The Original Quote</h3>
              <p class="mt-2">"Because we don’t know when we will die, we get to think of life as an inexhaustible well... How many more times will you watch the full moon rise? Perhaps twenty. And yet it all seems limitless."</p>

              <h2 class="slide-title">From Quote to Composition 🎶</h2>
              <p class="slide-subtitle">This meditation on mortality directly inspired the track "fullmoon" on his 2017 album, <i>async</i>.</p>

                      <p>Sakamoto sampled the quote and had it translated and read by native speakers in various languages, creating a global chorus contemplating the same question.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div>
                      <h3 class="font-bold text-lg">Bertolucci's Final Performance</h3>
                      <p>For the final Italian narration, he casually asked director Bernardo Bertolucci. Bertolucci agreed immediately, recording the lines that would become one of his last vocal performances before his death a year later.</p>

      <div class="slide">
        <div class="slide-container">
          <h2 class="slide-title">A Difficult <span class="highlight">Journey</span></h2>
          <p class="slide-subtitle">Sakamoto provides a frank and detailed account of his battle with cancer.</p>
          <div class="slide-content">
            <ul>
              <li><b>2014:</b> First diagnosed with oropharyngeal (throat) cancer, which was successfully treated.</li>
              <li><b>June 2020:</b> Diagnosed with rectal cancer during a check-up in New York.</li>
              <li><b>December 2020:</b> Discovered in Japan that the cancer had metastasized to his liver and lymph nodes—a fact his New York hospital had failed to communicate. This led to a profound <span class="font-bold">loss of trust</span>.</li>
              <li><b>January 2021:</b> Underwent a massive, 20-hour surgery in Japan to remove multiple tumors.</li>
            </ul>

      <!-- Slide 8: The Grim Prognosis -->
      <div class="slide">
        <div class="slide-container">
            <h2 class="slide-title">Confronting the <span class="highlight">Prognosis</span></h2>
            <p class="slide-subtitle">After discovering the metastasis, he was given a blunt prognosis by a Japanese doctor.</p>
            <div class="slide-content">
                <div class="p-6 bg-red-50 border border-red-200 rounded-lg">
                    <h3 class="font-bold text-lg text-red-800">"You have about 6 months left."</h3>
                    <p class="mt-2">He was shocked and angered by the doctor's tone, which left no room for hope. It was a purely statistical, objective assessment that felt devoid of humanity.</p>
                </div>
                <p class="mt-8">Incredibly, the very next day, Sakamoto performed a <span class="font-bold">pre-scheduled online solo piano concert</span>. He felt he played poorly, his mind in turmoil, but those who knew him well praised the performance, finding a unique depth in it.</p>
            </div>

        <div class="slide-container">
          <h2 class="slide-title">The Mind's <span class="highlight">Labyrinth</span> 🧠</h2>
          <p class="slide-subtitle">After the 20-hour surgery, he experienced several bouts of intense delirium, a common side effect of general anesthesia.</p>
          <div class="slide-content">
              <ul>
                  <li>He woke up convinced he was in a regional hospital in <span class="font-bold">Korea</span>, trying to communicate with nurses in broken Korean.</li>
                  <li>He messaged his assistant, "I'm going to be late for the meeting," while unable to move his body.</li>
                  <li>He was haunted by a continuous loop of an old Japanese TV commercial jingle he didn't even like.</li>
                  <li>Though frightening, he also found the experience fascinating, a glimpse into the surreal, automatic, and vast storage of the subconscious brain.</li>
              </ul>
          </div>
        </div>

          <div class="slide-container">
              <h2 class="slide-title">Saved by <span class="highlight">Love</span> ❤️</h2>
              <p class="slide-subtitle">Recovery was a difficult process, marked by physical pain, complications, and emotional despair.</p>
              <div class="slide-content grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-8">
                  <div>
                      <h3 class="font-bold text-lg">Fighting Back</h3>
                      <p>Nurses urged him to get out of bed and walk to prevent muscle atrophy. Despite the pain and weakness, he forced himself to sit on the sofa, read, and listen to music.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div>
                      <h3 class="font-bold text-lg">"Romi-Julie"</h3>
                      <p>Due to COVID-19 restrictions, his partner couldn't visit. Instead, every evening they would wave their smartphone flashlights to each other across the street—a ritual they nicknamed 'Romi-Julie' (Romeo and Juliet).</p>

          <div class="slide-container">
              <h2 class="slide-title">Questioning <span class="highlight">Time</span></h2>
              <p class="slide-subtitle">Sakamoto's illness intensified his lifelong philosophical inquiry into the nature of time.</p>
              <div class="slide-content">
                  <p>He argues that music is often called a "time-based art," progressing along a linear path. However, his experiences led him to question this premise.</p>
                  <div class="mt-8 p-6 bg-gray-50 border border-gray-200 rounded-lg">
                    <h3 class="font-bold text-lg">Time as an Illusion</h3>
                    <p class="mt-2">After years of reading philosophy and physics, he concluded that the concept of 'absolute time'—a constant, forward-moving force independent of the observer—is an illusion <span class="font-bold">created by the human brain</span>.</p>
                  </div>

      <div class="slide">
        <div class="slide-container">
          <h2 class="slide-title">The Impulse to <span class="highlight">Destroy</span></h2>
          <p class="slide-subtitle">A surprising experience after the premiere of his theatrical work <i>TIME</i> at the Holland Festival.</p>
          <div class="slide-content">
            <p>After years of work, he watched the "final" performance and suddenly felt a powerful urge to destroy it. He has always disliked "formal" or fixed things, and the idea of a work being "complete" and static felt like a creative death. This impulse was a new and startling experience for him, a testament to his desire for art to remain a living, changing entity.</p>

            <div>
              <h3 class="font-bold text-lg">A 30-Second Flash</h3>
              <p>The iconic melody came to him in a flash of inspiration, taking only about 30 seconds to form in his mind at the piano.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3 class="font-bold text-lg">Acceptance</h3>
              <p>For over 10 years, he refused to play the piece in concert, tired of its overwhelming popularity. He finally came to terms with its importance to his audience after seeing Carole King perform "You've Got A Friend" and realizing the joy it brought people.</p>

          <h2 class="slide-title">Life's True <span class="highlight">Form</span></h2>
          <p class="slide-subtitle">Sakamoto's thoughts on accepting the natural course of life and death.</p>
          <div class="slide-content">
            <p>He reflects that in a pre-modern era, he would have died at 62 with his first cancer diagnosis, and that would have been considered a long life. The relentless modern pursuit of prolonging life at any cost felt questionable to him.</p>
            <div class="mt-8 p-6 bg-gray-50 border border-gray-200 rounded-lg">
                <h3 class="font-bold text-lg">A Natural End</h3>
                <p class="mt-2">He expresses admiration for the philosophy of "Today is a good day to die," a mindset that embraces death as a natural part of life, not a failure to be fought off with painful treatments. While he still underwent treatment, he fundamentally believed in living and dying naturally.</p>

          <h2 class="slide-title">Music Sets You Free 🕊️</h2>
          <p class="slide-subtitle">The title of his 2009 autobiography, <i>"Ongaku wa Jiyuu ni Suru"</i> (Music Makes You Free), was a deliberate commentary.</p>
          <div class="slide-content">
            <p>It's a satirical twist on the infamous Nazi slogan "Arbeit macht frei" (Work sets you free). For Sakamoto, music was the true source of liberation.</p>
            <p class="mt-4">This idea became even more potent for him in the face of political turmoil like 9/11 and his own personal "prison" of cancer. Even when the body is not free, the act of creating and listening to music offers moments of escape from pain and suffering.</p>
